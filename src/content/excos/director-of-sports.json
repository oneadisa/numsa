    "bio": "I am Eghabor Zekeri, the director of sport of this great organization Numsa, born on the 16th of June, and I am a blend of both extroverted and introverted tendencies, often referred to as an ambivert. While I can be very friendly and sociable in certain situations, I also have moments of shyness, especially when meeting new people or navigating unfamiliar environments. One of the things that defines me most is my deep care and concern for others. This innate empathy is what ultimately led me to choose the path of becoming the Director of Sports. I believe in the power of sports to unite communities, foster teamwork, and promote physical and mental well-being, and I am dedicated to leveraging this platform to make a positive impact."
