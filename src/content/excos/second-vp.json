    "bio": "My name is Olatunji Adebola Eunice, and I am currently serving as this wonderful association's second vice president. I have a strong enthusiasm for graphic design, photography, guitar playing, and singing. I have a strong desire to see NUMSA flourish as a whole, and I'm putting a lot of effort into linking the preclinical and clinical parts of medical school. Being in the center of all the 'action' and actively being involved in decisions that impact both medical school arms is what makes this office so fascinating."
