  "bio":"My name is Daramola Oluwademilade Isabella and I’m the Director of Welfare of NUMSA 2023/2024 administration. I am from Kwara state but reside in Abuja. In my leisure time, you’ll often find me listening to music,xreading novels, watching tv shows or spending time with my loved ones. People often say I look unapproachable but I’m just shy. I cherish the relationships I build with people and try to help people with any needs that may be within my power. I am committed to offering assistance to those facing challenges, and lending a listening ear to those seeking solace."
