    "bio": "My name is Ukatu Kennedy Chidera, and I am honored to hold the position of Treasurer for the NUMSA 23/24 administration. I come from Anambra State, where I've lived my whole life, deeply connected to its vibrant culture. Video games are my go-to hobby, offering me a chance to unwind and have fun. I enjoy delving into political discussions, finding them both stimulating and enlightening. While I might seem quiet at first, once you get to know me, you'll find I'm quite outgoing and love to chat."
