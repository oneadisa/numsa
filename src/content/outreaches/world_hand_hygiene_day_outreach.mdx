**Nile University Medical Students' Association Leads the Charge on Hand Hygiene Day**

On May 6, 2024, the Nile University Medical Students' Association (NUMSA) took the lead in promoting hand hygiene at Junior Secondary School, Jabi, Abuja. This initiative, chaired by Maryam Umar, the Local Officer for NiMSA-SCOPH (Standing Committee on Public Health), was part of the global celebration of World Hand Hygiene Day. In collaboration with the RUBADI Foundation, the team hosted an impactful session on personal hygiene and sanitation, distributing free sanitizers to the students to emphasize the importance of cleanliness in preventing infections.

**Setting the Stage for Cleanliness**

The event was designed to be both engaging and educational. Students were not only taught the critical moments for handwashing but were also shown the proper techniques to ensure their hands are clean, even in situations where soap and water are not available. This hands-on approach made the learning process more impactful and memorable.

**Action Stations: Learning in Motion**

The atmosphere was buzzing with activity. At the education station, the Founder of the RUBADI Foundation shared essential insights into the necessity of proper hand hygiene. The President of NUMSA then elaborated on the potential infections and health complications that could easily be prevented by regular handwashing. Maryam Umar and her team took this a step further, emphasizing the importance of spreading these lessons beyond the school environment to family and friends. The team also underscored the importance of consistently adhering to these hygiene practices.

At another station, free sanitizers were presented to the schoolâ€™s Principal, Vice Principal, Head Boy, and Head Girl. They participated in a demonstration, showing their peers the correct way to use hand sanitizers effectively.

**Learning Through Interaction**

The day kicked off with interactive and informative talks. Students were engaged in open discussions, where they shared their thoughts on hygiene practices before being taught the critical times for hand hygiene and its significant role in reducing disease transmission. The students then practiced proper handwashing techniques under the guidance of the medical students, reinforcing the message of cleanliness and its importance.

**Lasting Impact**

The outreach surpassed expectations, reaching over 200 students. However, the true success of the event lay in the heightened awareness and the seeds of behavioral change that were planted. Students not only gained valuable public health knowledge but also became ambassadors for better hygiene practices. The school, too, committed to instilling these life-saving practices in both current and future students.

This World Hand Hygiene Day event was a powerful demonstration of how education and community engagement can work hand-in-hand to promote public health. It highlighted the profound impact that simple actions, like proper handwashing, can have on the well-being of students when driven by enthusiasm and dedication.
