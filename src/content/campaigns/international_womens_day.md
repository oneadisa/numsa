On **International Women's Day**, we take a moment to acknowledge the incredible impact of women in medicine. 

From trailblazing researchers and compassionate caregivers to resilient leaders and tireless advocates, women have shaped the landscape of healthcare in profound ways. As medical students, let's honor their legacy by championing equality, diversity, and inclusion in our training and future practice. 

Let's commit to supporting and uplifting women in medicine, ensuring that their voices are heard and their contributions are recognized. Happy International Women's Day!
