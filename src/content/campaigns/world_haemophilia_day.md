**WORLD HEMOPHILIA DAY**

Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to clot blood properly, leading to prolonged bleeding episodes. There are two main types:

1. Hemophilia A: This is the most common type, caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIll.

2. Hemophilia B: Also known as Christmas disease, it is caused by a deficiency in clotting factor IX.

Symptoms:
- Prolonged bleeding from minor cuts or injuries
- Easy bruising
- Joint pain and swelling, particularly in weight-bearing joints
- Excessive bleeding after surgery or dental procedures

Treatment:
- Replacement therapy: Infusing clotting factor concentrates to replace the missing factors.
- Desmopressin: Stimulates the release of stored factor VIII in mild cases of hemophilia A.
- Gene therapy: Emerging treatment that aims to correct the genetic defect responsible for hemophilia.

Challenges:
- Cost of treatment and access to care.
- Complications such as joint damage and inhibitors (antibodies against clotting factors).
- Physical and emotional impact on individuals and their families.

World Hemophilia Day:
Observed annually on April 17th, it aims to raise awareness about hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. The day also advocates for better access to treatment and support for those affected by the condition.
