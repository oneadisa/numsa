On this *International Day of Women and Girls in Sciences*, we proudly celebrate the remarkable achievements and contributions of women in science within the Nile University Medical Students Association. 

In a field traditionally dominated by men, our association stands as a beacon of gender equality and empowerment, with an impressive 75% representation of women among our members. From the very beginning, women have played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of science at our institution. 

Our pioneer set, led by exceptional female leaders, has set a standard of excellence that continues to inspire future generations. It is a testament to their dedication and perseverance that we proudly boast the best graduating student to be a doctor among our ranks. 

Today, as we reflect on the journey of women and girls in sciences, we recognize the challenges they have overcome and the barriers they continue to break. Yet, in the face of adversity, they have thrived, demonstrating resilience, intelligence, and unwavering determination. 

We applaud the achievements of our female members who have excelled in various scientific disciplines, from medicine to research to innovation. Their passion for discovery, coupled with their commitment to excellence, has propelled our association to new heights and enriched our academic community. 

As we honor the accomplishments of women and girls in sciences, let us reaffirm our commitment to gender equality and inclusivity in STEM fields. Let us create an environment where every aspiring scientist, regardless of gender, has the opportunity to pursue their dreams and make a meaningful impact on the world. 

Together, let us continue to champion diversity, empower women and girls, and build a future where science knows no boundaries. Happy International Day of Women and Girls in Sciences!
