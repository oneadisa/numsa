**WORLD MALARIA DAY**

In Nigeria, malaria remains a significant health challenge, with over 97% of the population at risk of infection. The disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly among children under five and pregnant women. 

Efforts to combat malaria in Nigeria include the distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and the promotion of prompt and effective treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapies.
