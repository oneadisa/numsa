**WISE NOTES ON THE THE WORLD BLOOD DONOR DAY 2024**

Donating blood is a vital act that can save lives and improve healthcare outcomes. Here are some reasons why blood donation is important:

***1. Saves Lives:*** Blood donations help patients undergoing surgery, trauma victims, and those with blood disorders like sickle cell disease and thalassemia.

***2. Rare Blood Types:*** Donations from individuals with rare blood types (e.g., O negative, AB positive) are crucial for patients with matching needs.

***3. Blood Components:*** Donated blood is separated into components like red blood cells, platelets, and plasma, each used for specific medical purposes.

***4. Short Shelf Life:*** Blood has a limited shelf life (35-42 days), making regular donations necessary to maintain a stable supply.

***5. Low Donor Turnout:*** Only a small percentage of eligible donors actually donate, emphasizing the need for more people to participate.

***6. Altruism:*** Donating blood is a selfless act that demonstrates compassion and community service.

***7. Personal Benefits:*** Donating blood can help donors learn their blood type, get a free medical screening, and feel a sense of fulfillment.

Every donation counts, and the importance of blood donation cannot be overstated. By giving blood, you can make a significant difference in someoneâ€™s life!
