**HER VOICE, HER FUTURE:INVESTING IN SURVIVOR-LED MOVEMENTS TO END FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION**

*Female genital mutilation (FGM)* is a deeply entrenched practice that has inflicted untold suffering on millions of women and girls around the world. On the International Day of Zero Tolerance to Female Genital Mutilation, we stand in solidarity with survivors and reaffirm our commitment to eradicating this harmful practice once and for all. 

The theme *'Her Voice, Her Future'* highlights the importance of empowering survivors of FGM to lead the charge in ending this human rights violation. 

Survivors are not just passive victims; they are powerful agents of change whose voices must be heard and respected. By investing in survivor-led movements, we acknowledge the resilience and strength of those who have experienced FGM firsthand and recognize their invaluable contributions to the fight against this harmful practice. 

Survivors bring a unique perspective to the discourse on FGM, offering insights into the cultural, social, and psychological factors that perpetuate the practice. Their lived experiences serve as a powerful tool for advocacy, education, and awareness-raising efforts. 

By amplifying their voices and stories, we challenge misconceptions, dispel myths, and inspire action at all levels of society.Investing in survivor-led movements entails providing resources, training, and support to survivors to become leaders, advocates, and change-makers in their communities. 

It means creating safe spaces for survivors to share their stories, access psychosocial support, and heal from the trauma of FGM. It also involves empowering survivors to engage with policymakers, healthcare providers, and religious leaders to advocate for policy change, legal reform, and the implementation of preventive measures.
