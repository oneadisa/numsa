      <span
        >However, the theme and sub themes serve to explore and reveal the complex interplay between the intricate
        relationship linking obesity and mental health. Also, emotional eating, stress, and depression can contribute to
        weight gain, while body image and self-esteem concerns eating disorders and the harmful effects of bullying and
        stigmatization which further compounds this connection between the theme and subtheme. Understanding these
        dynamics is essential for promoting holistic well-being.
